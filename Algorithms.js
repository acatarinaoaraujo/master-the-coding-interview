/** RECURSION **/

/* A function that refers to itself inside a function.

  Problem: the computer needs to allocate memory to remember things, stack overflow can occur when we have recursion and there
  is no way to stop the recursive call.

  Rules:
  1. Identify the base case - when to stop.
  2. Identify the recursive case.
  3. Get closer and closer and return when needed. Usually you have two returns.
